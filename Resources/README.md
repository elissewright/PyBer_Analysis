# PyBer Rideshare Analysis 

## Overview of the Project: 
### The purpose of this project was to analyze data from PyBer, a ridesharing company, in order to gather statistics on numbers of rides, fares, drivers, and other metrics across different types of locations serviced by PyBer. This data may be used to evaluate and make improvements to the service for prospective customers and drivers. 

### We used Python, specifically the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, to analyze and visualize the data. Location types included Rural, Suburban, and Urban. 

## Key Results: 

### Rides by Location:
#### We found that among the 3 location types served by PyBer, Urban areas had the highest number of rides, while Rural had the lowest number of customers served. Urban areas have a denser population, leading to greater demand for services; additionally, urban residents may be less likely to own a personal vehicle than Suburban or Rural residents. 

### Drivers by Location:
#### Like total number of rides, there was a strong relationship between driver numbers and type of city, with Rural areas having the least number of total drivers and Urban having the highest. The disparity here was severe, with only 78 drivers servicing Rural locations, compared to 490 for Suburban and 2,405 for urban. Despite lower numbers of customers in these locations as well, there is a legitimate concern that these individuals are not being adequately served by the limited drivers here. 

### Total and Average Fares by Location:
#### While the higher customer base in Urban areas resulted in these locations bringing in a higher total in fares than Suburban and Rural areas, the individual fares were higher for Rural and Suburban areas. This is likely a result of Rural and Suburban rides being longer on average than a typical Urban ride. 

### Average Fares for Drivers:
#### Average fares per driver were much higher per ride for Rural areas at $55.49 than Suburban and Urban rides at $39.50 and $16.57, respectively. 

## Discussion of Findings: 

### While demand was lower overall in Suburban and Rural areas, services in these locations may still be more crictically important for individuals who do use Pyber, as public transit and other transportation services are very limited in these areas. Therefore, these neighborhoods may be considered underserved, and PyBer may consider some options to reach out and better serve current and prospective customers living outside of Urban locations. 

## Reccomendations:

### Many prospective customers living in Rural and Suburban locations may not be aware of Pyber and its services. PyBer may attract new customers by focusing future advertising campaigns on these areas. Local physical ads and online ads on social media platforms may increase their customer base. 

### PyBer may consider providing a one-time new customer discount for individuals living in remote areas, who may be reluctant to try the service due to up front costs. This is a good way to attract repeat customers. PyBer may also consider offering continuous discounts for specific residents living in Rural locations who may be in greatest need of rideshare services, such as senior citizens and individuals with disabilities. 

### Finally, Pyber may also increase services to underserved areas by offering additional pay bonuses for drivers who choose to serve customers living in Rural and Suburban locations. The average fare per driver is already higher for these rides, on the basis of miles driven. However, drivers may be less willing to work in these areas or take longer rides due to inconvenience or gas costs. Additional bonuses and rewards for servicing customers in more remote locations may incentivize drivers to accept these rides, serve more customers, and increase business and profits for PyBer.
